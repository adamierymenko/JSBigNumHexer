JSBigNumHexer
======

You know how it feels. Sometimes you just have one of those days when you have to
convert an arbitrary-sized number in string format to/from different bases in
JavaScript, which has no native support for integers larger than 2^53.

Well you're in luck. Search no more.

    JSBigNumHexer.convert(str,fromBase,toBase)

[The actual code is not by me. Go here for the original. I just modernized it.](http://danvk.org/hex2dec.html).

Public domain as far as I know.
